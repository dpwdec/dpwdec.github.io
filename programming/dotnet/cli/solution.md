You can **add a project to your solution** by navigating to your project's root folder where the solution file is and then running the `add` command with the file path to your project folder.
```bash
dotnet sln add path/to/project/folder
```

You can **remove a project from your solution** using the same command format but replacing `add` with `remove`.
