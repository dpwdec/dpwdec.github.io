How did we deal with this project.

We split our group of six people into three pairs. We split our project's features into three main groups: users, listings and bookings. Each pair worked on implementing the features relating to one of these elements.

This emerged organically because our user stories ended up with three distinct nouns. The `user` noun, describing what the user could generally do. The `host` noun describing what a user who is acting as host might want to do the `guest` noun describing a user acting as someone who wants to book a place to stay. This clarified a way in which the user stories could be fairly easily separated between our group.

We followed a procedure of recording a list of things that we wanted to accomplish on a trello board. This acted as a good way not only to track features and additions but also as nice positive feedback for having some result when successful because we could set the task to green.
This worked better than github issues because we could make notes and get more feedback.
