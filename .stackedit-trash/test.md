## Development Process

  

Our team used an agile development process with periodic sprints to deliver Acebook to our client with regular check ins and feature updates. This allowed us to integrate changes in specification late into development and keep the team running by dividing up dividing up tasks during the sprints. We used a process of branches, pull-request code reviews and continuous integration testing pipelines to keep our code clean and dependendable.

### Domain Model

  

We employed extensive domain and database modelling for our application before beginning development as well as diagramming the flow of the application. Furthermore we integrated a react frontend controller that used asynchronous fetch requests to parse JSON data from our server to create a modern web application. There are links to our wiki with this planning below:

## Testing

  

### Test Server

  

The test server must be running for integrationt tests to pass.

The test server runs on port `3030` at [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)

  

- Start test server on **Mac**:

```

npm run start:test

```

  

- Start test server on **PC**:

```

npm run start:pc

```

  

### Run Tests

  

- Run all tests:

```

npm test

```

  

- Run `jest` unit tests:

```

npm run test:unit

```

- Run `cypress` integration tests:

```

npm run test:integration

```
