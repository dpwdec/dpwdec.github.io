`Discord.js` is a feature rich library for interacting with the discord API. It's generally thought to be less performative than other javascript discord integrations.

You can **install `Discord.js`** with `npm`.
```bash
$ npm install discord.js
```

You can **start using the `Discord.js` library** by `require`ing it.
```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
```
