## Scheduled Jobs

Scheduled jobs are **not guaranteed to run** *or* **guaranteed to run on time**. When a scheduled job is called a request is made to Github actions machines for the job to run and is run once a node is free. This can vary the time from 3-10 minutes but it can be as long as an hour and can sometimes not be run at all if the lag time is long enough. M
