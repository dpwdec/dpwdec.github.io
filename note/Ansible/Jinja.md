Jinja templating in ansible allows you to use the more programmatic functionality of the jinja engine to processes ansible data, such as filters, templating etc.

## Range

You can **generate a list in a range** using the `range` filter with the start and end of the list as arguments.
```yaml
- name: Create list
  
```
