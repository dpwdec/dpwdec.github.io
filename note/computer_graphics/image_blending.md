You can **evenly blend *n* number of images** by simply scaling the value of each pixel in each input by \\( \frac{1}{n} \\) and then adding the resulting scaled pixel values to the final image. For example, if you had *four* images that you wanted to evenly blend then for output pixel \\( x \\) would be

\\[ x =  \\]
