**Querystring** is a built in node utility for parsing query strings in client requests into a Javascript object as key-value pairs

You can **start using `querystring`** by requiring it.
```js
const qs = require('querystring')
```

You can **turn a querystring into an object** by using the `parse` method.
```js
const query = 'name=M
```
