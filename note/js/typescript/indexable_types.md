**Indexable Types** allow you to add arbitrary indexable properties to typescript objects which are still constrained by types.

To **declare an indexable type** put the keyword `index` in `[]` square brackets with either a `number` or `string` type followed by the type that the index will hold. *Typescript objects can only be indexed by number
