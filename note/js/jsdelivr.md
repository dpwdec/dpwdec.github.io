Jsdelivr is an "open source CDN" that allows you to remotely load Javascript into a browser, it can load this code **directly from any public github repo** and allows you to quickly get scripts into websites. This is useful because loading in `src` code from Github source files is blocked by default with a set of headers. For example you could not use the following line
