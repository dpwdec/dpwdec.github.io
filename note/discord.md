**Applications that you create are linked to your discord account**. You can **create a new discord application** by going to the [Developer Dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and clicking `New Application`.

## Bots

**Bots** are used to **control actions that happen on your server**. Bots are *contained* inside individual applications.

You can **create a new bot** by going to the `Bot` tab and selecting `New Bot` in the Developer Dashboard.

Bots have a **personal login** shown at the top of the bot page. The **bot token**, displayed on the bot page is used to control the bot account so **KEEP IT PRIVATE**.

You can **add a bot to a discord server that you have admin privileges on** by usi
