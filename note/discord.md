It is **not recommended to interact directly with the Discord API** instead there are a [host community supported wrappers for the API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/community-resources#libraries) that are much more reliable. The main purpose of building a discord integration directly from the discord API would be for learning.

**Applications that you create are linked to your discord account**. You can **create a new discord application** by going to the [developer dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and clicking `New Application`.

**Bots** are used to **control actions that happen on your server**
