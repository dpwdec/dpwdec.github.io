You can **create a new virtual environment** by using the `virtualenv` command followed by the name of the environment you want to create. By convention this is simply called `env`.
```bash
$ virtualenv env
```

To **activate your virtual environment** use the `source` command with the path of the `ENV_NAME/bin/activate` file. This will change your console so that you are working in the virtual directory environment for your project. Once inside the virtual environment you can install dep
```bash
$ source env/bin/activate
```
