You can **add a new testing project** by `RMB` clicking on the project file and going to `Add -> New Project` and then selecting the `C# -> Tests` section and choosing a test project. The **accepted naming convention for these projects** is `NameOfProject.UnitTests`, or some other test descriptor separate by a `.` period.

The **convention for test class naming** is `NAME_OF_CLASSTests` so if we were testing a class called `User` the associated test class would be `UserTests`. **Tests classes are indicated** by using the `[Test Class]` decorator.
```csharp
[Test Class]
publi
```
