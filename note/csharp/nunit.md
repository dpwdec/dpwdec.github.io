You can **add a new testing project** by `RMB` clicking on the project file and going to `Add -> New Project` and then selecting the `C# -> Tests` section and choosing a test project. The **accepted naming convention for these projects** is `NameOfProject.UnitTests`, or some other test descriptor separate by a `.` period.
