Package specific **nuget pages offer a range of ways to install a package**. The can **install packages via the command line** with `.NET CLI` or install them by **adding references directly in your project's `.csproj` file** using the `Package Reference` method.

You can **add the latest stable version of a package to your project** by removing the version number from the end of the `.NET CLI` install command.
