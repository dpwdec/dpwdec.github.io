## Arrays

You can **initialize and create a new array in a single line** by defining the array type followed by `{}` curly brackets containing the contents of the new array.
```csharp
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

You can **initialize a new array after creation** using the `new` keyword combined with the type followed by the standard array creation shorthand syntax.
```csharp
int[] arr; // define a variable to hold an array
arr = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // fill the int array
```
