A `Guid` is a **globally unique identifier**. A `Guid` is a `128` bit integer with `5,316,911,983,139,663,491,615,228,241,121,400,000` possible unique combinations. A `Guid` **can be used to uniquely identify something in your system**, it has a very low probability of being replicated.

You can **create a new `Guid`** by using the `static` method on the `Guid` class, `NewGuid()`. This will generate an entirely new random `Guid`.
