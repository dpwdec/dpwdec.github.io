Extension methods are **methods added to an existing type WITHOUT extending, recompiling or modifying the existing type**. Extension methods are `static`, however, they can be **used as if they were instance methods**. A frequently used example of extension methods is the `Linq` library which adds a range of methods to collection objects using extensions.
