Latex is a type-setting engine that allows for full controlling of document formatting and content control.

## Classes

A `documentclass` defines the basic layout for a document. This is defined at the head of your document file with the class of document inside `{}` curly brackets.
```latex
\documentclass{article}
```

## Document

The text of your document is placed between the `begin` and `end` tags that mark the body of the document.
```latex
\begin{document}
Some document text
\end{document}
```
