Logging for dotnet applications is configured by default in the `CreateDefaultBuilder` method in the `Program.cs` file.

The logging you see when you start a default dotnet application for the first time, something like...
```
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Now listening on https://localhost:5001
```
is part of logs output by microsoft's default logging behavior and picked up the default configured logging architecture.
