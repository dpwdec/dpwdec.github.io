ACL stands for **access control list** and is used to control who can access S3 buckets and the objects *inside* those buckets. While bucket policies are usually reserved for controlling access for an entire bucket, ACLs (when used in the context of S3) can be used to control access to individual S3 objects. You can find an explanation on the differences between bucket policy, IAM and ACLs [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47815526/s3-bucket-policy-vs-access-control-list/47818804).

They are also considered a legacy service.
