title: Virtual Private Cloud
---

A **virtual private cloud** or VPC is an isolated network that spans all availability zones where a feature is deployed.

VPC allows you to isolate features into their own networks within a single AWS account, or allows for the connection of local and cloud based data centres.

The **default VPC** is the default account VPC that all features on an account are placed into.
