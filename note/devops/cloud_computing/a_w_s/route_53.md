title: Route 53
---

Route53 takes its name from port `53` which is used to route TCP and UDP internet traffic.

Route53 allows you to **create URL aliases for features**. These URLs are part of **hosted zones** which define the end of the URL.

Each zone then contains a set of **records** which define aliases for a service and a further destination (in the `route traffic to` property) to forward requests to that record's alias to.
