A **message broker** usually refers to a piece of infrastructure that is responsible for sending a receiving messages. Asynchronous APIs are generally **message broker centric**.

A subscriber or consumer manifests and interest in a certain type of message and then **leaves a connection open** to the message broker so that it can have messages pushed to them.
