## REST APIs

A **REST** API or **Representational State Transfer** API is a software routing style for handling requests to a server and returning information. REST uses several different verbs to describe how requests to a server are routed and what they are intended to do.

 1. `GET` - *Retrieve* a resource
 2. `POST` - *Create a new* resource
 3. `PUT` - *Replace* a resource *in its entiety*
 4. `PATCH` - *Update* a resource
 5. `DELETE` - *Delete* a resource

## HATEOAS

**HATEOES** stands for **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State** and describes a REST architecture where a client requests information about a resource and then uses the response from the server to action the actions available to be taking by client on a resource change depending on the state of the resource.
