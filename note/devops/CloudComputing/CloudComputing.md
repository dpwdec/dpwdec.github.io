Cloud computing is **on-demand delivery of compute, database storage and applications via the internet**. Essentially you are **just renting someone else's computer**.

The **advantages of cloud computing**:

1. **Trade capital expense for variable expense**: don't have to invest in infrastructure, *only pay for what you use*.
2. **Benefit from economies of scale**: because Amazon have so many server resources you would never able to find cheaper compute from your own infrastructure.
3. **Stop guessing about capacity**: provisioning your own servers can cause problems with under-utilized or over-utilized infrastructure, by making use of granular scaling you can use exactly the capacity you need. *(Similar to 1?)*
4. **Increase speed and agility**: Using serverless architecture you can scale infinitely and not have any servers or virtual machines running.
5. **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centres**: You don't have to pay for maintaining any infrastructure yourself, only the configuration of that infrastructure.
6. **Go global in minutes**: Easily deploy your application in multiple regions

## Cloud Computing Types

There are **three types of cloud computing**:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service** (IaaS): The service itself has no access to your server, they simply give the client infrastructure and the client manages the infrastructure themselves such as the operating system, patching etc. An *example of this* would be the `EC2` instance.
2. **Platform as a Service** (PaaS): The service manages operating systems, hardware as well as updates and maintenance, the client just focuses on managing their applications.
3. **Software as a Service** (SaaS): The service manages everything apart from the actual way you use the software.
