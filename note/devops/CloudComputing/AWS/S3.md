S3 stands for **simple storage service**. It is one of AWS's longest serving products and is defined by Amazon as a "secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage" system.

S3 is used for storing **flat files** e.g. text, video, images - files that do not change periodically and have already been encoded. This is not suitable for database storage.

S3 is an **object based storage system**: it is used for storing files and content. This is in contrast to a **block based storage system** which is used for installing an operating systems etc.
