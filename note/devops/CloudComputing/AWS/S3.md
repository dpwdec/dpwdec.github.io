S3 stands for **simple storage service**. It is one of AWS's longest serving products and is defined by Amazon as a "secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage" system.

S3 is used for storing **flat files** e.g. text, video, images - files that do not change periodically and have already been encoded. This is not suitable for database storage.

S3 is an **object based storage system**:

- It is used for storing files and content and allows you to upload files.
- Files can be between 0 bytes and 5 terabytes in size.
- Storage is unlimited

This is in contrast to a **block based storage system** which is used for installing an operating systems etc.

S3 files are **stored in buckets** which are like folders in the cloud. 

When creating a new bucket, the **bucket name must be unique globally** across the entire AWS S3 storage system. Buckets are available at URL in the format `https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<bucket name>` which adds a unique DNS entry to amazon for access to the bucket. This is why the bucket namespace has to be globally unique.

When you **successfully upload a file** to S3 you will receive a status code `200` which allows you to test if an upload was successful or not.

An Object in S3 **consists of**:

- `Key`: The name of the object e.g. `menu.txt` or `funnycat.gif`
- `Value`: The data that makes up the object (as a sequence of bytes)
- `Version ID`
- `Metadata`

They also contain **subresources** consisting of:

- `Access Control Lists`
- `Torrent`
