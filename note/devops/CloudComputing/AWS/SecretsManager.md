**Secrets Manager** is a service similar to Vault for storing sensitive credentials that needed by services.

## Manual Secret Creation

You can **create a new secret** by going to the `Secrets Manager` console and clicking `Store New Secret`.

You can **store any type of data as a set of key-value pairs** by using the "Other type of secrets" option when storing a new secret. A single secret can accomplish several pairs of data.

You can **view sample code in a range of languages that retrieves your secret** in the "sample code" section when creating your secret.
