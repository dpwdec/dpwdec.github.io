## Credentials

You can find information about SDK credentials [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html).

You can **give the AWS SDK automatic access to AWS credentials** by saving your AWS account credentials in a `.aws` folder in your home directory in a file called `credentials`.
```yaml
[default]  
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>` 
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```
