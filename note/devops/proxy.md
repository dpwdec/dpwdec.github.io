## Proxy

Proxies make requests on behalf of a client so that the **destination server doesn't know the identity of the client**. Clients can **visit a proxy by specifying its location in their request headers**.

A proxy can **locally cache static results for requests** and return that cached result to repeat requests from different clients, cutting down costs.

A proxy can also **block particular destinations for clients**.

### Geofencing

A proxy can used to **block clients from accessing content** based on their location.

## Reverse Proxy
