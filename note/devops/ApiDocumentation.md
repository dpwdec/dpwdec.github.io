Swagger is a service that allows you to generate API documentation programmatically from `YAML` or `JSON`.

## ReDoc

ReDoc is a service built on top of Swagger that allows you to turn Swagger specs easily into HTML.

You can **generate a zero dependency HTML file for your spec** by using the `redoc-cli` command with the `bundle` utility.
```bash
$ npx redoc-cli bundle <SPEC FILE>
```
