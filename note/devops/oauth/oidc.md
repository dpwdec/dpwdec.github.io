OIDC or **Open ID Connect** is a service built *on top* of the OAUTH spec to allow developers to support authentication requests using the OAUTH flow. The OAUTH protocol was designed to only support authorization. That is, giving one application authorization to access functionality on another application. In this use case, identifying tokens are unnecessary, the application simply needs an access token which it can use to perform actions on its users behalf. So, when companies started using OAUTH to perform authentication it caused issues as they all developed their own ways to developing *on top* of the OAUTH spec to provided this authentication functionality.

The OIDC spec is an attempt to **standardise authentication using the OAUTH protocol**.
