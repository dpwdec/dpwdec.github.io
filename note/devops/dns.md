DNS (Domain Name System) 

When a DNS service contains a link to another DNS service this is known as a **merged** set of DNS records. For example, we might have service `A` that holds DNS records for a range of IPs on the domain `foo.com` and entry to `bar.com` which links to an upstream server `B` which holds records for a range of  `bar.com`.
