Docker is an application containerisation system.

Applicatons are **deployed in three steps**:

 1. Creating a `Dockerfile` that describes how a docker image is built
 2. Building a docker image file
 3. Running the docker image file in docker

## Hub

You can **find existing images to use as a base for your custom images** by using the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) service. It is possible to **host private docker image repositories** in your own infrastructure.

The Docker Hub has a registry and repository structure for holding images.
