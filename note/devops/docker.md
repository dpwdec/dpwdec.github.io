Docker is an application containerisation system.

Applicatons are **deployed in three steps**:

 1. Creating a `Dockerfile` that describes how a docker image is built
 2. Building a docker image file
 3. Running the docker image file in docker

You can **see what images are available to run in docker** by using the `images` command.
```bash
$ docker images
```

## Hub

You can **find existing images to use as a base for your custom images** by using the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) service. It is possible to **host private docker image repositories** in your own infrastructure.

The Docker Hub has a registry and repository structure for holding images.

**Official** images hosted on the hub are maintained by the creators of the service they host and should be go to for hosting docker content.

You can **pull an image down from the docker hub to run locally** using the `pull` command followed by the name of the image. By default this pulls the **latest version** of the image.
```bash
$ docker pull <IMAGE_NAME>
```

For example:
```bash
$ docker pull hello-world
```

You can **pull a particular version of a docker image** by adding a `:` colon to the name of an image followed by the version.
```bash
$ docker pull <IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_VERSION>
```

For example:
```bash
$ docker pull ubuntu:16.04
```
