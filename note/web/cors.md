CORS (**Cross Origin Resource Sharing**) is a security feature as part of browsers. It only effects APIs that are interacted with directly through a browser. 

Browsers use CORS to block requests to endpoints that are at a different origin from the site that is making the call unless the endpoint that is being called explicitly permits traffic by returning a response with the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header pointing to the calling origin.
