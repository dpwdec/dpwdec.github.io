**Cookies** are **key-value pairs of information** stored locally in a browser. 

If a user leaves a website for some time the cookie will remain stored on their machine so that when they return to a website their cookie (if not expired) can be sent back to the server to retrieve a session.

A cookie is **updated** when a server sends a new cookie. This **can happen asynchronously** if you have a page that makes asynchronous calls to a server that update cookie then that will be displayed in the browser.

When a cookie **expires** it is deleted by the browser and *not* sent to the server.
