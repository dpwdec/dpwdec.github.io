## Modes

There are **three main modes**:

- `command mode`
- `insert mode`
- `command line mode`

You can **switch to `insert mode`** by pressing `i` in the `command mode`.

You can **save a file a vim** by using the `:w` command followed by the name of the file if you are saving it for the first.
