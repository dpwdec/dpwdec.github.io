## Modes

There are **three main modes**:

- `command mode` - the base mode for the editor
- `insert mode` - used for editing text
- `command line mode` - used for saving and loading files

### Command Mode



You can **switch to `insert mode`** by pressing `i`, `I`, `a`, `A` or `o` in the `command mode`.

You can **switch back to command mode** by using `ESC`.

You can **save a file a vim** by using the `:w` command followed by the name of the file if you are saving it for the first.
