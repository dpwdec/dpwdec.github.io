## Modes

There are **three main modes**:

- `command mode` - the base mode for the editor
- `insert mode` - used for editing text
- `command line mode` - used for saving and loading files

### Command Mode

You can **switch back to command mode** by using `ESC`.


### Insert Mode

You can **switch to `insert mode`** by pressing `i`, `I`, `a`, `A` or `o` in the `command mode`.

### Command Line Mode

You can **execute command line mode commands** by starting them with a `:` colon.

You can **switch to the vim help file** by using the `:help` or `:h` command.

You can **quit a file without saving** by using the `:q!` command.

### Visual Mode

**Visual mode** allows you to select elements in a file visually.

You can **save a file a vim** by using the `:w` command followed by the name of the file if you are saving it for the first.
