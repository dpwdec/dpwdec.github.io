You can **permanently** add environment variables to all future bash terminal sessions for a user by editing the `bash.rc` file in the user's `$HOME` directory. This is done using the `export` keyword.
```
/.bash.rc
export MY_VAR="50m3 c0nt3nt"
```
You will need to reload your terminal before you can use these new environment variables.
