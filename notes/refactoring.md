Code comments that mention elements of your code with an apparent name *should* match the names in code. For example:

If you can extract a method within a class into a separate `private` method which the class delegates responsibility to, there is a good chance that you can extract this method into its own class.


## Code review

Code reviews are usually conducted once a pull request has been made on github as a way of ensuring the quality of code before it is merged into the main project.

To offer feedback on pull request code visit the `pull request` of your repo and select the request you want to review. You can see new additions in the request's code by going to `changed files` tab 

using the files changed section on the pull requests section
you can also CMD + F to find specific elements that you want to review

you can leave comments on someone's pull request from the `changed files` section by using the "+" on the side to leave a comment.
