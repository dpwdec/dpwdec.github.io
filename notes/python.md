## Strings

You can **convert an int to a string** using the `str` method.
```py
x = 5
print("this number is " + str(x))
# => this number is 5
```

You can use **string interpolation** by appending an `f` to the beginning of a string (outside the opening `"` quote marks) and using `{ }` curly brackets around the variables you want to interpolate.
```py
x = 7
print(f"this number is {x}")
# => this number is 7
```
