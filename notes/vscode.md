You can **select an entire word or symbol** using the `CMD + D` shortcut. By pressing this keyboard shortcut multiple times you will switch **multi-word editing mode**, this will select each same word after the initial word you selected you can then type to replace them.

You can **configure code formatting settings by language type** by going to the `Preferences: Configure Language Specific Settings` using the keyboard command `CMD + SHIFT + P`  and then selecting the language you want to edit from the list and then changing the displayed `.json` file to contain the desired settings. Below, is an example of the `.json`, edited for python to set the default tab size for that language to `4`.
```json
