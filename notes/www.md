## Request / Response Cycle


## HTTP
HTTP or **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol** is a protocol that allows two applications to communicate across the web. HTTP is structured to on a **client** and **server** relationship in which hypertext documents are exchanged between the two parties. A client can be an application such as a web browser, but it can also be another server or API call requesting data for some other purpose. The essential distinction being that one party requests and the other responds. 

Hypertext is a structured document that uses **hyperlinks** between nodes. HTML or **Hyper Text Markup Language** is used to manipulate the hypertext so that the `client` can request different types of media (such as images, text or data) from the server.


HTTP is an **application protocol** and is based on TCP/IP which is a **communication protocol** or **transport protocol**. It is important to keep this distinction in mind as TCP/IP is designed for transferring data whereas HTTP is designed to allow applications to format data in an effective way and share it between each other.
