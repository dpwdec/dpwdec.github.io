## HTTP
HTTP or **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol** is a protocol that allows two applications to communicate across the web. HTTP is structured to on a **client** (such as a web browser) and **server** relationship.


HTTP is an **application protocol** and is based on TCP/IP which is a **communication protocol** or **transport protocol**. It is important to keep this distinction in mind as TCP/IP is designed for transferring data whereas HTTP is designed to allow applications to format data in an effective way and share it between each other.
