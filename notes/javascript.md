#### Constants
Constants are Javascripts **immutable** variables. They are defined using the keyword `const`.  
```javascript
const N = 204
N = 300 //ERROR
```
Javascript are **actually just constant references to variables**. This means that you **cannot change a primitive constant**, but you **can change the properties of an object constant**. 
```javascript
const profile = { name:"Tatsuki", age:"59" }
profil
```
