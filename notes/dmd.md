UML - unified modelling language

wireframe.cc
diagram.codes

Class diagram displays classes and methods on them
A sequence diagram shows how different classes interact

where the arrow points indicates the method being called on that object

object --hello()--> thing
This calls the hello() method on the thing object.

return types are returned with dotted lines back --> this can contain the return type or even the value

There are 13 types of UML diagrams


why was I not able to use a CONSTANT for class methods inside my sinatra object?

the model CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ITS OWN APP

4xx are for user errors

you can have multiple servers running on a single machine
databases are visually referenced by a cylinder


NOT changes OR to AND and logical comparators to their inverse i.e. `>` becomes `<=`

INSERT INTO table_name (column_list)
VALUES
    (value_list_1),
    (value_list_2),
    ...
    (value_list_n);

the resistance

crc --> class responsibilities and collaborators
agile modeling class responsibility collaborator CRC

a responsibility is what a class knows, or what a class does

something is a collaborator of class if that collaborator is required for that class to complete its responsibilities.]

when you have a ONE TO MANY relationship you put the foreign key in the MANY table.

MANY to MANY relationships in a middle man table

es5 was the previous version js
in this syntax classes are define with functions
```js
function Parrot(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

//add a 
Parrot.prototype.speal = function() {
  alert('hello');
};

```

use the `debugger` function to pause execution and in chrome you can use the dev tools to step through your code in the `Sources` tab of the dev tools.

you can define fucntion inside classes without the function keyword
