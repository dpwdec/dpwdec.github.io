UML - unified modelling language

wireframe.cc
diagram.codes

Class diagram displays classes and methods on them
A sequence diagram shows how different classes interact

where the arrow points indicates the method being called on that object

object --hello()--> thing
This calls the hello() method on the thing object.

return types are returned with dotted lines back --> this can contain the return type or even the value

There are 13 types of UML diagrams


why was I not able to use a CONSTANT for class methods inside my sinatra object?

the model CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ITS OWN APP

4xx are for user errors
