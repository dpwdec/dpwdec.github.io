Capybara is a ruby framework for remotely controlling a browser by performing actions like visiting websites, clicking links and filling out forms procedurally. This framework can be leveraged in combination with [RSpec](https://dpwdec.github.io/notes/rspec.html) to create a way of testing that your webpages work correctly, for example, checking that links click through correctly and forms display as you intend.
