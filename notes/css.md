## Alignment

You can **put two `div`s on the same line** using the `float` css indicator. In the example below, `div`s with the `id="same-line"` will float next to each other rather than being separated by a line break.
```css
#same-line {
  float: left;
}
```

You can **form a `div` onto a new line** using the `clear` indicator.
```css
#new-line {
  clear: left
