## Getting Started
To install Postgresql use `homebrew`.
```
brew install postgresql

You can use brew to automatically run the postgres application in the background on your computer when you start your computer with the `brew services` command. This command will automatically start postgres when you log in.
```
brew services start postgresql
```
