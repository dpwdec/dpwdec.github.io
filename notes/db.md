## Relational Databases
A relational database is a type of database that stores data so that it can be accessed in *relation* to other pieces of data. Each row in a table is called a **record** and has its own unique index, called a **key**. By mapping these keys as fields into other tables databases can be made to act in a relational manner.

Relational databases' physical storage and logical storage are separated. This means that databases files can be moved and renamed without effecting the name of tables inside the database and not interfering with how people access the database information.

| Physical storage | Logical storage |
| ---  | --- 
| the name of the databases | database tables |
| how users connect to the databases | table indexes |
| | table views
