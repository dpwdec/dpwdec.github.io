You can use a **local host** server in aws by setting the locahost output port to `8080`. When running a server on this port aws will notify you with a link to the local hosted url and port to access the page.

Aws will not always give you correct feedback on local host deployment, launching error messages even when the server is running correctly. You can check by **manually visiting the localhost url**. This url takes the form of `[unique EC2 instance id].vfs.cloud9.[region].amazonaws.com`. You can find your unique EC-2 instance id by going to `serv

Any **url extensions** wil got be appended to this url.
