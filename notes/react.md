## Create React App

Create React App is a light weight micro-framework for initialising a simple react app. CRA offers a minimal server side interface that transpiles react code into pages for clients.

You can **create a new react app** in an existing folder, **without installing it as a dependency** using the `npx` command. The `.` period at the end of the `create-react-app` command indicates that you want to create the app *in* the current directory so make sure you navigate to that directory in your `CLI` first.
```bash
$ npx create-react-app .
```
