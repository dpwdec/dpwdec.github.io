React is a front end Javascript framework for creating dynamic web pages.

## Structure

React is a designed as a **single page web application framework**. All elements of react are mediated through a single `.html` file (usually `index.html` which contains a `<div>` with an `id` or `root`. It is into this `div` that your react app will output all of its content.
```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

The **entry point for a React app** is `index.js`. This file uses the `ReactDOM` 

## Components

## Create React App

Create React App is a light weight micro-framework for initialising a simple react app. CRA offers a minimal server side interface that transpiles react code into pages for clients.

You can **create a new react app** in an existing folder, **without installing it as a dependency** using the `npx` command. The `.` period at the end of the `create-react-app` command indicates that you want to create the app *in* the current directory so make sure you navigate to that directory in your `CLI` first.
```bash
$ npx create-react-app .
```
