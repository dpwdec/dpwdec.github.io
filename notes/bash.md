## Scripts

You can **create a bash script** by giving a file the `.sh` extension.
```
my_script.sh
```

To **start writing a script**

You can **run a bash script** by simply typing the name of the script file (or path to the file prepended by a `./`).
```bash
$ ./my_script.sh
```

Your script may not have execution privileges. To **make your script executable** use the `chmod +x` command.
```bash
$ chmod +x my_script.sh
```
