Sinatra is a lightweight web framework for building small web applications in ruby.

## Start up
You can **install Sinatra** by simply including the `gem Sinatra` in your `Gemfile` and running the `bundle` command.

You can **start a Sinatra app running** i.e. listening and functioning as a server by using the `ruby` command in the terminal to run whichever is the main file in your Sinatra project.
```
ruby myapp.rb
```
