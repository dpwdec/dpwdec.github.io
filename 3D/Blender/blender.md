**Background images** are **applied on a "per camera" basis.** You can **set a background image for your camera** by:

 1. Selecting a camera
 2. Toggle on `Camera Settings -> Background Images`
 3. Go to `Camera Settings -> Background Images -> Add Image` and navigate to the image you want to display

You can **change the aspect ratio of a background image** by changing the `Output Properties -> Resolution x/y`.

You can **toggle global wireframe** with `⇧ + Z`.

You can **move the viewport zoom centre while in camera mode** with `Hold ⇧ + Pan MMB`. This only changes viewport display of the camera view, does not effect camera position of zoom, its purely for checking and aligning things in the viewport while in camera mode.
