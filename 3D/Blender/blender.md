 2. Toggle on `Camera Settings -> Background Images`
 3. Go to `Camera Settings -> Background Images -> Add Image` and navigate to the image you want to display

You can **change the aspect ratio of a background image** by changing the `Output Properties -> Resolution x/y`.

You can **toggle global wireframe** with `â‡§ + Z`.
