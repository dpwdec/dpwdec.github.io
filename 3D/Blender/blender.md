**Background images** are **applied on a "per camera" basis.** You can **set a background image for your camera** by:

 1. Selecting a camera
 2. Toggle on `Camera Settings -> Background Images`
 3. Go to `Camera Settings -> Background Images -> Add Image` and navigate to the image you want to display

You can **change the aspect ratio of a background image** by changing the `Output Properties -> Resolution x/y`.

You can **toggle global wireframe** with `⇧ + Z`.

You can **move the viewport zoom centre while in camera mode** with `Hold ⇧ + Pan MMB`. This only changes viewport display of the camera view, does not effect camera position of zoom, its purely for checking and aligning things in the viewport while in camera mode.

You can **projection map a rectangular texture
