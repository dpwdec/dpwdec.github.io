You can **express the summation of some number of terms of a sequence** using *sigma* or *summation* notation.

This notation follows the pattern

\\[ \sum^{x}_{n = 0} 2n + 1 \\]

Where \\( x \\) is the end term of the summation and \\( n \\) is the start term - which can be set to anything using the \\(  = \\) and it is followed by a definition of the sequence.

So, if we wanted to get summation of term \\( 10 \\) to \\( 20 \\) of the sequence \\( 2n + 1 \\) we would write it as

\\[ \sum^{20}_{n = 10} 2n + 1 \\]
