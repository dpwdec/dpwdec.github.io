The **point slope formula** allows you to calculate the equation of a line from a point on a line and its gradient. It's given by the formula:

\\[ y - y_0 = m(x - x_0) \\]

Where \\( m \\) is the gradient of the line, \\( y_0 \\) and \\( x_0 \\) are the actual points sampled from the graph, and \\(x \\) and \\( y \\) are variables in the final equation.

This formula is derived from the standard slope \\( \frac{dy}{dx} \\) where:

\\[ \frac{y - y_0}{x - x_0} = m \\]

For example, if you have a graph with gradient of \\( 3 \\) and a point \\( (3, 2) \\) then this can be substituted into the point slope formula as:

\\[ y - 2 = 3(x - 3) \\]

So the equation of the line is:

\\[ y = 3x - 7 \\]
