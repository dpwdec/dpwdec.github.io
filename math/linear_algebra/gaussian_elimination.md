Gaussian elimination is an algorithmic like process of solving a system of linear equations by reducing unknowns in the system until a single unknown has been isolated and then plugging the unknown back into the system.

For a system of \\( n \\) equations with \\( n \\) variables

1. Use algebra to create a system of \\( n - 1 \\) equations with \\( n - 1 \\) variables. *Eliminate one variable from the system*.

2. Repeat step one with the current equations until only 1 variable remains.

3. Plug the known variable back into the original system of equations and solve algebraically.
