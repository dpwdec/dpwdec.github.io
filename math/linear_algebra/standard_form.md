You can **convert directly two points on a line into a standard form equation** using the formula

\\[ a = y_2 - y_1  \\]

\\[ b = x_1 - x_2  \\]

\\[ c = a \cdot x_1 + b \cdot x_2  \\]

This will not usually produce the *simplest* formula for the equation. It *works well for computer code* if you just need to work with a linear system of coefficients.
