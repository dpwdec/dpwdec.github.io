## Fractional Exponents

**Raising a number to a fraction is the same as taking the demoninator corresponding root of the number.** For example \\( 9^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{9} \\) and \\( 4^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{4} \\).

The **reason that fractional exponents evaluate to the root of a number** can be explained by reference to the rules of exponents. We know that when you multiple exponents they "add", such as \\( 2^5 \times 2^2 = 2^7 \\). So when we multiply \\( x^{\frac{1}{2}} \times x^{\frac{1}{2}} \\) we know that the two halves must add together to equal 1 in the form \\( x^1 \\) which is the same as just \\( x \\). So we multiplied together two of the same things to get another thing which is essentially the definition of a square root, i.e. \\( \sqrt{x} \times \sqrt{x} = x \\). Therefore raising \\( x^{\frac{1}{2}} \\) must be equal to \\( \sqrt{x} \\).

**Raising a number to a fraction with a numerator greater than one** means that you first root the number based on the demoninator and then raise it to the power of the numerator. For example: \\( 2^{\frac{2}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}^{2} = 2\sqrt{2} \\).
