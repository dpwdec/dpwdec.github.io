The **natural log** is simply tells you **what number to raise \\( e \\) to so that it equals another number**. This is defined as the **inverse** of \\( e^x \\) because it takes *in* a number and tells you the exponent in relation to \\( e \\).

The **natural log** of \\( 2 \\) is \\( 0.6931 \\). So

\\[ e^{0.6931} = 2 \\]

## Notation

The **natural log is usually written as**

\\[ ln(x) \\]

## Time interpretation

The natural log can be **interpreted as the time that it takes to grow by a specific amount**. For example, if you had an investment compounding at \\( 100% \\) and you wanted to know how long it would take for the investment to grow by \\( 12 \\) times, you could compute this by taking the natural log of \\( 12 \\), or \\( ln(12) \\) which is \\( 2.484~ \\). So it would take almost 2.5 years to get a 12 times increase in your original amount.

The **natural log of \\( 1 \\) is always \\( 0 \\)**. As is the case with *all* logarithmic functions, because whenever you have to raise something to power to equal \\( 1 \\) that power *must* be \\( 0 \\). I

You can **interpret the natural log of fractional numbers** as returning negative time. Or, what the amount would have been in the past if we reversed the compounding.
