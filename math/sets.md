A **mathematical set** is a collection of, unordered, unique objects. For example, `{ 🍋, 🍊, 🍈 }` is a valid set, however, `{ 🍋, 🍊, 🍊 }` is not a valid set because the `🍊` is repeated.

Sets are usually **notated** with `{ }` curly brackets. This is called **roster notation** or **enumeration notation**.

Sets are usually **named** with capital letters, such as `A` and `B`. 

Sets are **equal** if all their elements are the same. This called the **extensionality of sets**.
