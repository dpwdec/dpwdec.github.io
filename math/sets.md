A **mathematical set** is a collection of, unordered, unique objects. For example,`{ 🍋, 🍊, 🍈 }` is a set, and `{ 🍋, 🍊, 🍊 }` is also a set, but this is considered equal to the set `{ 🍋, 🍊}` because repeated elements do not change the structure of the set.

### Roster Notation

Sets are often **notated** with `{ }` curly brackets. This is called **roster notation** or **enumeration notation**.

You can **abbreviate sets that proceed is a predictable pattern** by using an `...` ellipse, for example `{1, 2, 3, ..., 100}` for a set of all integers up to 100.

### Set Builder Notation

Sets can also be notated as a **selection from a larger set according to a condition**. In the example below the `|` pipe character is read as "such that" (a **colon is also used here sometimes**) and reads `"F is a set of all numbers n, such that n is an integer in the range from 0 to 19 exclusive"`.
```
F = { n | n is an integer, and 0 < n < 19 }
```

Sets are usually **named** with capital letters, such as `A` and `B`. 

Sets are **equal** if all their elements are the same. This called the **extensionality of sets**.

A set **with only a single element** is called a **singleton set**. `{ 🍊 }` is an example of a singleton set.
