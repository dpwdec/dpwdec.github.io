Logarithms are an **inverse function of exponents** that allow you to express the reverse of that exponential function so as to find the exponent of that function. 

For example, if you have some function \\( v = b^{p} \\) where we know the value of \\( v \\) and \\( b \\) and we want to find \\( p \\). (These letters are chosen because they stands for *value*, *base* and *power* respectively!) You can **take the logarithm of \\( \mathbf{v} \\) in a base of \\( \mathbf{b} \\)** to find \\( p \\). Which is like asking: to what power must I raise \\( b \\) to in order to get \\( v \\)? This is given by \\( p = log_b v \\). This is said as "\\( p \\) is equal to the log of \\( v \\) in base \\( b \\)".

Expressed more formally, this is:

\\[ p = log_b v \text{ is equivalent to } v = b^p\\]

### Basic Examples

**1)** Given the logarithm \\( log_2 16 \\) what power must you raise `2` to, to get `16`?

We know that \\( p = log_2 16 \\) where \\( p \\) is the power we are searching for, and we can re-write this in *exponential form* as \\( 16 = 2^p \\). It's then clear that \\( p \\) must be equal to `4` because \\( 2^4 = 16 \\).

**2)** What is the *real* value of \\( log_4 16 \\)? This is asking for the same thing as the question above.

\\[ p = log_4 16 \text{, so } 16 = 4^p \text{, so } p = 2 \\\\ \text{ therefore: } log_4 16 = 2\\]
