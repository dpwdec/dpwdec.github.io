title:  "The everyday joy of testing" 
---

I coded a lot before I ever wrote a test for my code, and, had I not been forced to start testing (by attending a software development course that enforced code testing at every level) I may *never* have written any tests for my code and would not have known how much clarity, reliability and peace of mind I was missing. I can say that testing is one of the joys in development that I look forward to because I've experienced the hell that occurs if you *don't* test and I don't want to return to that.

## Before Testing

All that "code" that I wrote before starting to test was a complete mess because it was almost impossible to debug and find errors. My feedback loop for finding errors in my code was **running the entire program and create a `print` statement at the end of the code and manually checking if it was the output I expected**
