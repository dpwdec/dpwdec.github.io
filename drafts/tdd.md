I coded a lot before I ever wrote a test for my code, and, had I not been forced to start testing (by attending a software development course that enforced code testing at every level) I may *never* have written any tests for my code and would not have known how much clarity, reliability and peace of mind I was missing. I can say that testing is one of the joys in development that I look forward to because I've experienced the hell that occurs if you *don't* test and I don't want to return to that.

## Before Testing

All that "code" that I wrote before starting to test was a complete mess because it was almost impossible to debug effectively, find errors and sometimes to even know if errors had occurred. My feedback loop for finding errors in my code was something like this:

- Change the input values for my code manually
- Put a print statement somewhere in my code to get visibility on an output
- Run the entire program
- See if the output matches my expectation

This was a really slow, manual process that
